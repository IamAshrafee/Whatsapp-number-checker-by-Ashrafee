# WhatsApp Number Checker – A browser extension to check which phone numbers are active on WhatsApp Web.

## The Problem

For marketing teams and individuals who use WhatsApp to connect with their audience, verifying which phone numbers are active on the platform is a tedious and time-consuming task. The manual process of copying and pasting each number from a list into WhatsApp to check for a valid profile is slow, inefficient, and prone to errors. This repetitive work takes away valuable time that could be spent on more important marketing activities.

## The Solution

This browser extension streamlines the process of verifying WhatsApp numbers directly within the WhatsApp Web interface. It helps you quickly identify which numbers from a list are active on WhatsApp, saving you hours of manual work. The extension is designed to mimic human-like behavior, with random delays and pauses, to ensure a smooth and reliable checking process. It's not a bulk messaging tool, but a utility to assist in validating your contact lists efficiently.

## Key Features
